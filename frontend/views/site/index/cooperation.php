<p>i need to find teacher of php</p>

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I am beginner on upwork. 
I so happy that so many people agree to help me. And it's so quickly. I thought that I will see the first proposal in some weeks, but in result))) really good.
Really now i don't know how to choose)</p>

<p>I am very busy nearest week. But in some days I want to improve my level in PHP, Yii2.

I have many intresting work. If honestly I have salary 2,5 -20 $/hour. I like my job and I agree to do for free sometimes. But sometimes I lose many time for simple thing in coding (this reason why I look for a teacher).

I am honest man. I am open. My id in social nets is halva202. 
I know english enough for to read, but for spelling or speaking I wait more good results. My native is russian.</p>

<p>I can create simple sites on php. I can use yii2 for this purpose. I know a little js and css. But I prefer logic job. 

Really i don't have special education in programming. I am master of degree in chemistry. But now a half of day I am php-programmer, a half of day I am tutor (physic, chemistry, mathematic).
For me no reason how much money I will get on upwork first time, I want to have start here. Really my salary is from 2,5 till 20 $/hour. I like my jobs, i like my life.

I like to create logic things like calculator on my site repetitor.github.io.
I have job in team. Our portfolio is on cvr.by</p>

<p>Best regards, Viktar</p>
